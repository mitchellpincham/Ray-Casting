# Ray-Casting
Written in Python and Pygame

Open settings.txt to change the settings of the game - IMPORTANT do not delete or add any lines or the game will break
that is why I added a backup

With opening main.py or filled.py the editor will open draw lines with the mouse then press enter to continue

the rays will follow the mouse

formulas.py will do nothing
